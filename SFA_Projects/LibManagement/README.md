A simple Library Management Console Application. It allows librarians to store and retrieve information regarding books, authors, clients and orders in a fast and convenient manner. Using this API, a librarian can register a new client, add a new book or author to the database, create an order and gather different kinds of information depending on their needs.
The librarian has the ability to create an order for a book and assign it to a client. The client and book are to be chosen from a list of pre-existing ones.
Librarians are able to retrieve a list of all placed orders along with information for each.
